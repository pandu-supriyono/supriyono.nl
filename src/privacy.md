Long story short: I take your privacy very seriously.
That's why I personally don't collect any (personal) data.

Long story long: I use some third-party services to deliver this website to you.
They might handle your privacy differently. 

I host this website on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). I trust that they are
making a (good) effort in complying with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 
and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). According to [their policy](https://www.netlify.com/gdpr-ccpa/),
they save access logs in their servers for 30 days, which contains your IP address. To exercise your 
privacy rights, you can contact Netlify. You can also contact me and we can see if we can arrange a solution together.

If you would like to take a look at the source code for this website, you can do so on [this website's GitHub repository](https://github.com/pandu-supriyono/supriyono.nl). I invite you to make suggestions with regards to safeguarding user privacy (as well as other things that you may want to see).
