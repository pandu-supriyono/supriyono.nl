Utrecht-based web developer 👨🏽‍💻 focusing on building inclusive and
resillient web applications. What drives me is to work towards a (perhaps
digital) future in which everyone counts and is empowerered in society. 

Currently freelancing, mostly building internal as well as public digital
sevices for the Indonesian Embassy in The Hague 🇮🇩 🇳🇱. I recently finished a
[training programme for social entrepreneurship](https://www.missie030.nl/interview-pandu) 
as part of my community service.
