Utrecht-based web developer 👨🏽‍💻 focusing on building inclusive and
resillient web applications. What drives me is to work towards a (perhaps
digital) future in which everyone counts and is empowerered in society. 

Currently web/app developer at [Unc Inc](https://www.uncinc.nl/), building
digital services for social organizations. Recently, I finished a
[training programme for social entrepreneurship](https://www.missie030.nl/interview-pandu) 
as part of my community service.
