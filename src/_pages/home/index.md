Utrecht-based web developer focusing on building accessible and resillient web applications.
What drives me is working towards a (perhaps digital) future in which just and equal access to information and services is normal.

Currently web and app developer at [Unc Inc](https://www.uncinc.nl/), building
digital services for social organizations. Here I work on an [app to help and encourage citizens to recycle](https://www.hvcgroep.nl/download-de-hvc-app),
among some other projects.
