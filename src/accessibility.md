It is important that the web is accessible to everyone. In this page I document
what I do to make sure this website is accessible.

This website is designed to be usable according to the [Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/). I also try to keep this website as
simple as possible to create a pleasant experience and to avoid complexity.

However, this is not a guarantee that this website is accessible. It is not
actively tested by a diverse group of people due to there not being enough
budget. To improve this website's accessibility, I rely on my own
experience, guidance from the web community and informal feedback from users.

I am actively trying to improve my writing skills. This website is where I
practice. My goal is to write so that people who have a [B1 level of English in
the Common European Framework of Reference
(CEFR)](https://www.coe.int/en/web/common-european-framework-reference%20languages/level-descriptions)
can read and understand my written work. A B1 level of English is similar to a
4.0 - 5.0 IELTS score or 42 - 72 TOEFL iBT score.

The source code to this website is also [available on
GitHub](https://github.com/pandu-supriyono/supriyono.nl). If you find a problem
with this website, [please let me know by mail](mailto:mail@supriyono.nl).
